  copy_labels_pattern:
    description: >
      Regex pattern to match github labels which will be copied from the original pull request to the backport pull request.

      Configure experimental features by passing a JSON object.
      The following properties can be specified:

      #### `detect_merge_method`

      When enabled, the action detects the method used to merge the pull request.
      - For "Squash and merge", the action cherry-picks the squashed commit.
      - For "Rebase and merge", the action cherry-picks the rebased commits.
      - For "Merged as a merge commit", the action cherry-picks the commits from the pull request.

      By default, the action always cherry-picks the commits from the pull request.

      #### `conflict_resolution`

      Specifies how the action will handle a conflict occuring during the cherry-pick. 
      In all cases, the action will stop the cherry-pick at the first conflict encountered.

      Behavior is defined by the option selected.
      - When set to `fail` the backport fails when the cherry-pick encounters a conflict.
      - When set to `draft_commit_conflicts` the backport will always create a draft pull request with the first conflict encountered committed.

      Instructions are provided on the original pull request on how to resolve the conflict and continue the cherry-pick.
    default: >
      {
        "detect_merge_method": false,
        "conflict_resolution": draft_commit_conflicts
      }
  github_token:
    description: >
      Token to authenticate requests to GitHub.
      Used to create and label pull requests and to comment.
      Either GITHUB_TOKEN or a repo-scoped Personal Access Token (PAT).
    default: ${{ github.token }}
  github_workspace:
    description: Working directory for the backport action.
    default: ${{ github.workspace }}
  label_pattern:
    description: >
      Regex pattern to match the backport labels on the merged pull request.
      Must contain a capture group for the target branch.
      The action will backport the pull request to each matched target branch.
      Note that the pull request's headref is excluded automatically.
    default: ^backport ([^ ]+)$
  merge_commits:
    description: >
      Specifies how the action should deal with merge commits on the merged pull request.
      When set to `fail` the backport fails when the action detects one or more merge commits.
      When set to `skip` the action only cherry-picks non-merge commits, i.e. it ignores merge commits.
    default: fail
  pull_description:
    description: >
      Template used as description (i.e. body) in the pull requests created by this action.
      Placeholders can be used to define variable values.
      These are indicated by a dollar sign and curly braces (`${placeholder}`).
      Please refer to this action's README for all available placeholders.

  pull_title:
    description: >
      Template used as the title in the pull requests created by this action.
      Placeholders can be used to define variable values.
      These are indicated by a dollar sign and curly braces (`${placeholder}`).
      Please refer to this action's README for all available placeholders.
    default: >-
      [Backport ${target_branch}] ${pull_title}
  target_branches:
    description: >
      The action will backport the pull request to each specified target branch (space-delimited).
      Note that the pull request's headref is excluded automatically.
      Can be used in addition to backport labels.
      By default, only backport labels are used to specify the target branches.

  created_pull_numbers:
    description: >
      Space-separated list containing the identifying number of each created pull request.
